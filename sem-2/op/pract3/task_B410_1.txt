Plot
As described in a film magazine review,[2] in 1849, John Buckner, Kentuckian, goes West to the California goldfields and makes a fortune. Returning to Kentucky after a couple of years, he is convinced that his wife loves Gordon Carter and kills the latter in a duel. John heads West again taking his wife Elizabeth with him, although they are still on bad terms. Elizabeth's unfailing courage during the many perils of the journey wins John's esteem. After he rescues her when she is lost in a sandstorm, they are completely reconciled.
